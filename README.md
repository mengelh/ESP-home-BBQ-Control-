# ESP home BBQ Control
The ESP home BBQ Control makes it possible to control and monitor a BBQ using actuators commonly used in model making.

## CAD Designe
Documentation of the CAD design for the 3D printed parts of the controller housing, the sensor housing and the actuators.

### Controller Housing
In development will be added as soon as the final PCB design is available.

### Gas Regulator Actuator
At the moment there is only one design available for the [Napoleon Prestige 500](https://github.com/mengelh/ESP-home-BBQ-Control-/tree/main/CAD/Napoleon-Prestige-500/Gas-Regulator-Actuator), which rotates the gas regulator with the help of a [FT90M 270Â°](https://www.alibaba.com/suppliersubdomainalibabacom/product-detail/Feetech-FT90M-Micro-size-270-Degree-60541562298.html). This setup allows a complete rotation of the regulator.

### Rotisserie Actuator
In development will be added as soon as the final PCB design is available.

### Housing Weight Sensor
In development.
